# Password Generator

## Webpage description

I edited the Javascript on this page to create a working password generator that would take in criteria such as password length and character type. Then return it on the screen.

I originally did it by shuffling all chosen characters and shuffling then splicing the requested length but it couldn't make a password longer than the amount of characters in the arrays. eg couldn't do more than 10 numbers

## Features

1. will alert your password is too long or too short
2. will alert you if you don't choose character types
